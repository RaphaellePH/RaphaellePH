After 9 years within the Textile Industry, 7 of those specialized in the Lingerie business, working various jobs, from Product and Business Analyst to Buyer and Product Manager, I decided to take a turn in my career and explore a new career path in Tech. 
I therefore followed the Web Developer Bootcamp @Le Wagon (Batch-1003) during 24 weeks, from September 2022 to March 2023. 

Today, I am looking to merge all the soft skills acquired over the past 9 years, to the hard skills I have freshly learned through these intense 6 months of Bootcamp âš¡! 

If you're looking for a Junior Full-Stack, Back-End or Front-End Developer, contact me ðŸ“«!
